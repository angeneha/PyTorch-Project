## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##DESIREE Define the DNA sequence dataset by generating a score for each nucleotide. This section of code block is used to assign sequences a score for pytorch. For every 8-mer sequence the nucleotide sum based on the rule system, the assignment of a number to a letter, will be added and averaged to produce the score of the sequence.
